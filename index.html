                <h1>The highest peak on  Earth</h1>
                <p>Mount Everest, known as the highest mountain in the world, reaches an elevation of 8,849 meters. It is located on the crest of the Great Himalayas that lies on the border between Nepal and Tibet. This dangerous mountain is shaped like a three-sided pyramid. The three generally flat planes constituting the sides are called faces, and the line by which two faces join is known as a ridge.
                <br><br><br>
                Even though the first major expeditions began in the 1920s, the first time the summit was reached was in May 1953 by Tenzing Norgay. Mount Everest, also surnamed the “Peak of Heaven” has since attracted many climbers who have tried this unique experience, climbing to the top of the world. But it remains a dangerous and not always successful expedition that can end in death. This mountain is the result of more than 250 deaths.</p>

                <h2>The number of climbs per year</h2>
                <p>Everest represents a challenge, an opportunity to push back your limits that makes many people want to prove to themselves that they can do it.
                <br><br><br>
                Before the 1960s it was very difficult to access Everest, which is situated in a very isolated location, all goods and supplies had to be carried long distances by humans and pack animals. But since then, airstrips built in the Khumbu valley have greatly facilitated transport to the Everest.
                <br><br><br>
                That’s why the number of ascensions increased after the 60s and since then, it hasn’t stopped. The year with the most climbs is 2019 with 876 ascensions.
