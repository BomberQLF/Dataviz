                <h1>The highest peak on Earth</h1>
                <p>Mount Everest, known as the highest mountain in the world, reaches an elevation of 8,849 meters. It
                    is located on the crest of the Great Himalayas that lies on the border between Nepal and Tibet. This
                    dangerous mountain is shaped like a three-sided pyramid. The three generally flat planes
                    constituting the sides are called faces, and the line by which two faces join is known as a ridge.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Even though the first major expeditions began in the 1920s, the first time the summit was reached
                    was in May 1953 by Tenzing Norgay. Mount Everest, also surnamed the “Peak of Heaven” has since
                    attracted many climbers who have tried this unique experience, climbing to the top of the world. But
                    it remains a dangerous and not always successful expedition that can end in death. This mountain is
                    the result of more than 250 deaths.

                <h2>The number of ascensions per year</h2>
                <p>Everest represents a challenge, an opportunity to push back your limits that makes many people want
                    to prove to themselves that they can do it.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Before the 1960s it was very difficult to access Everest, which is situated in a very isolated
                    location, all goods and supplies had to be carried long distances by humans and pack animals. But
                    since then, airstrips built in the Khumbu valley have greatly facilitated transport to the Everest.
                    <br><br><br>
                    That’s why the number of ascensions increased after the 60s and since then, it hasn’t stopped. The
                    year with the most climbs is 2019 with 876 ascensions.

                <p>Everest is so tall and its climate so severe that it is incapable of supporting sustained human
                    occupation and it is indeed, really dangerous to climb. The most hospitable period for an ascent is
                    during April and May. Everest has a fatality rate at about 6.5 deaths per 100 successful
                    climbers.<br><br>
                    Since 1978, the deadliest years were 1996 with 15 deaths, 2014 with 16 deaths and 2023 with 18
                    deaths. The top 3 causes of death on Everest are Avalanche, Falls, and Acute mountain
                    sickness. There are different steps during the ascension, and the more you go in altitude, the more
                    it can be fatal. The higher risk of death is at the summit, between 8000 and 8850m. This is “The
                    Death Zone”, at this altitude, the body begins to die minute by minute and cell by cell due to a
                    lack of oxygen.

            <div class="environment-text-container">
                <p>One thing we don't often talk about is the fact that ascents of Mount Everest, once symbols of heroic feats, now have worrying environmental consequences. Every year, it’s hundreds of climbers that leave behind them large quantities of waste, including tents, oxygen cylinders, and human excrement. In 2019, the Nepali army collected 2 tonnes of waste, reflecting the size of the problem. Despite clean-up efforts, managing this waste remains difficult due to the extreme conditions at high altitude.</p><br>
                <p>Global warming is also contributing to additional challenges. The glaciers of Everest are melting at an accelerated rate, revealing debris and bodies left behind by past expeditions. This phenomenon undermines the stability of climbing trails. Melting ice is a direct threat to local biodiversity and the way of life of the Himalayan people, who depend on this water for agriculture and everyday needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="environment-img-container">
                <p>In addition to the waste, the carbon footprint generated by the expeditions is significant. The flights needed to reach the region, the intensive use of energy-hungry equipment, and the large number of base camps consume resources and exacerbate the climate crisis. These impacts, combined with tourism pressures, underline the urgency of rethinking access to Everest and adopting measures to minimize environmental damage while preserving this iconic site.</p>
